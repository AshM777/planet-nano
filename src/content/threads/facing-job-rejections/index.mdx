when facing rejection:
1. request detailed feedback
2. identify areas for improvement
3. assess your application strategy
4. refine your presentation
5. maintain professional relationships

## strategic pivoting

use rejections as opportunities to:
- reassess your career goals
- enhance your skill set
- expand your network
- improve your portfolio
- explore different industries

## maintaining resilience

remember that successful careers often include setbacks. focus on:
- continuous learning
- building relationships
- improving your craft
- staying adaptable
- maintaining perspective
