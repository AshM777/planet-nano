It's been a while since I started imagining the way computers interact with creative folks. Whatever we do is visible to the whole wide world and there are thousands of eyes looking at us.

I wanted to change this notion and start building my own blog website. To a lot of people out there, this might not be a big deal.
Afterall, what unique did I perform here?

- Started exploring static pages like Jekyll, Gatsby, and Astro.
- Got hands on to VS-Code, after 6 years of just passing my university exams in which I just opened and closed for loops to fill the pages.
- Running the project on my localhost.
- Deploying the project on Cloudflare.
- Learning how to write in Markdown.
- Publishing this **First Blog**.

You're right, Not a big deal. But somehow that inner child who stopped learning things a while back and got much comfortable, got back and spent hours learning something new.

A long way to go. Thanks for reading.
